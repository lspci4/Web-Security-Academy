Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.
